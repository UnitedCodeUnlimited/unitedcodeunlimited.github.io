<p>As business operations become more complex, the demand for change in IT increases,
along with the associated risks that must be mitigated. Today’s IT professionals are

with ever-increasing quality of service. And in today’s economic climate, IT must also
reduce budgets and derive greater value out of existing investments.</p>

quality of service, make more-efficient use of their budgets, and reduce the risk of
change in datacenters. Oracle Exadata Database Machine offers extreme performance
