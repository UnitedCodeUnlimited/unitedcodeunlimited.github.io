<p>Our company company United Code Unlimited (UCU) was contracted by UFlix2You board of directors to develop a plan to maintain and update the existing database that runs the Flix2You website. The name of this project is internally (within UCU) named as “I will Fix you - UFlix2You”</p>

<p>United Code Unlimited is going to design a solution that will create a data repository for easier querying and applying analytics to better understand Flix2You’s data. Having a new system will allow Flix2You to use their previous data and scale up properly with no issues when the traffic on their site increases.</p>

<p>Flix2You is movie rentals online business and functions like Netflix, Blockbuster, and Redbox. The primary focus of this business is to allow customers to make movie rentals online and have them sent to their homes. In order to grow their business and not concede to their competitors Flix2You needs to understand their data much better in order to make a informed new business strategy that will allowed them to increase revenue. Currently Flix2You is not in a position to access their data to make well-informed decisions and create a strategy for the business. United Code Unlimited needs to design solution for this and create solution for Flix2You employees to be able to produce hardcopy reports analysis but also a backend access via the website and see the data wherever and whenever they like.</p>
