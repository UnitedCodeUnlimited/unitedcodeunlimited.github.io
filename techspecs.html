<p>As collaboration has become more and more crowdsourced, we have started merge away from traditional systems, and have headed towards a world of open source solutions. Instead of relying on Microsoft Server or Enterprise Operating System, we now use Free BSD operating systems, and NginX Web Servers.</p>

<p>Depending on your needs, we will work with you to customize your hardware rather than buying pre-made hardware that you necessarily might not need.</p>

<p>Our technlogy stack proposal for Flix2You is below: </p>

<p>FreeBSD is free and open source Unix-like operating system from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and it is one of the most popular server platform. Designed with advanced networking, security and server storage. Until now freebsd has been ported to a variety of processor architectures, include PowerPC, Arm etc.</p>

<p>Nginx (pronounced engine-x) is a free and open-source high-performance HTTP server. Nginx focus on high concurrency, performance and low memory usage. And it is make nginx a one of the most popular a web server. You can use nginx also as reverse proxy for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer.</p>

<p>MariaDB is one of the relational database management system (RDBMS) forked from mysql and it is drop-in replacement for MySQL and developed by some of the original authors of MySQL. MariaDB strives to be logical choice for database professionals looking for a robust, scalable, and reliable SQL server.</p>

<p>FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative php FastCGI implementation. come with some additional features, like a process management, stdout and stderr logging, accelerated upload support, ability to start workers with different uid or gid and listening on different port. It is very useful for heavy-loaded sites.</p>
