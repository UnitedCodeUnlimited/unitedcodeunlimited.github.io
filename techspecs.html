<p>As collaboration has become more and more crowdsourced, we have started merge away from traditional systems, and have headed towards a world of open source solutions. Instead of relying on Microsoft Server or Enterprise Operating System, we now use Free BSD operating systems, and NginX Web Servers.</p>

<p>Depending on your needs, we will work with you to customize your hardware rather than buying pre-made hardware that you necessarily might not need.</p>
